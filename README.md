# Mean Shapes in Pulmonary Hypertension

This repository contains Visualization Toolkit (VTK) files to image process and visualize the 3D structure of a heart model derived from over 1500 healthy subjects and 250 patients with pulmonary hypertension.

## LVmyoPH.vtk

The mean 3D shape of the end diastolic left ventricular myocardium in pulmonary hypertension.

## RVmyoPH.vtk

The mean 3D shape of the end diastolic right ventricular myocardium in pulmonary hypertension.
